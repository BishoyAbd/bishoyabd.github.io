# About Me

I'm Bishoy Kamel, guided by the philosophy: "Dubito, ergo Cogito. Cogito, ergo sum." (I doubt, therefore I think. I think, therefore I am).

I believe that meaningful progress begins with questioning assumptions. By embracing doubt as a tool rather than an obstacle, I uncover insights that lead to innovative solutions.

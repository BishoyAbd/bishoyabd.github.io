Title: What if the AI companies are lying to us?
I have been thinking for quite some time about this question—sometimes it wakes me up during the night. Every cognitive process we do looks physically possible. What we are trying to do now is to reverse-engineer it, exactly as Demis Hassabis, the Nobel Prize winner, did with AlphaFold to restructure the protein structure. Our body could do it, and it's incredibly efficient and fast, so it is physically possible—they reverse-engineered it, and here we go.

The safety of AI is not just about making sure AI is under control, but more importantly, that the technology owners are under control. Just imagine if the richest men in the world decided to build robot farms, producing at massive scale, at the exact same moment humans are losing jobs. Just imagine if all of this happens very fast. What kind of world will we have?

If people lost their jobs and lost the meaning, they have already lost themselves—and the battle against the technology owners is already settled.

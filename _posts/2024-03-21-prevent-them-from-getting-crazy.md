What if AI Companies are lying to us? This question has haunted me for months—sometimes it even wakes me up at night. Every cognitive process we perform seems physically possible. So the real game now? Reverse-engineering it. Exactly as Demis Hassabis, the Nobel Prize winner, did with AlphaFold to reconstruct the protein structure. Our body could do it, and it's incredibly efficient and fast, so it is physically possible—they reverse-engineered it, and here we go.

The safety of AI is not just about making sure AI is under control, but more importantly, that the technology owners are under control. Just imagine if the richest men in the world decided to build robot farms, producing at massive scale, at the exact same moment humans are losing jobs. Just imagine if all of this happens very fast. What kind of world will we have?

If people lost their jobs and lost their meaning, they have already lost themselves—and the battle against the technology owners is already settled.

But let's try to examine the possible scenarios here.
before we proceed my dear reader i want to put some assumptions.

Every cognitive process we do is physically possible and we can reverse-engineer it.

I can think of two possible scenarios here: AI advances slowly or very fast. I want you to just think about it—most of the advances in AI, we have made in the past 15 years. I know that neural networks are not new. Okay, hold on—let's step back to the beginning of the last century when we put the principles of quantum mechanics to work. So basically, in one century we have been moving so fast.

So if you agree with me and the above assumptions hold, then it all boils down to the question of how fast we can reverse-engineer the human brain. Or *when*?

I can't answer the question of when, but I will try to think with you about the world we will live in if we can reverse-engineer the human brain.

We will have machines that think. Machines that learn. Machines that evolve.
Lawyers? Gone. Auditors? Replaced. Doctors, teachers, engineers, accountants? All obsolete—at the speed of software.

People lose their jobs and then lose power, in my opinion. The most important battle, in my opinion, is to prevent the technology owners from getting crazy. We need more research in this area. We need to make sure that the power is in the hands of the people.

We don't just need research—we need resistance. We need to make policies, pressure, and public power. Because if the future is decided by a few billionaires, it's not just our jobs we'll lose—it's ourselves.
